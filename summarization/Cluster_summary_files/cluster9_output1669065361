Tigers scored 40 runs between two games this week, I hope the pitching will hold out. I am involve in a Distant Learning project and am in need of Jpeg and Mpeg encode/decode source and object code.

We want to setup a repository where these files may be access such as Simte20 and start putting together a OTG FAQ. At present only DOS and UNIX environment is being worked on and it our hope that we can generate enough interest where all the major platform can be accomodated.
I am a novice user at best to the Windows environment. I am trying to execute a MS C++ 7.0 executable program which accesses a Btrieve database to build an ASCII file. When I execute it under windows the screen goes blank and my PC locks up. The only way for me to return is to reset the machine.
Can anyone provide information on CS chemical agent--the tear gas used recently in WACO? How can I get the font family, weight and slant from an instance of a widget? What gives Isreal the right to keep Jeruseleum? What can be done, short of circumcision, for an adult male whose foreskin will not retract?
