I have $30,000 as my budget. I'm looking for a sports or GT car. What do you think would be the best buy? I'd say an RX-7 would be RIGHT up there. I've got a pair of Oakley forsale. There are frogskins, with aurborn red. They are no scratches and only used them once or twice last summer.
I created a pixmap or drawable window, then used XDrawLine() function drawed a line as below:  width = 300. If you calculate x3 and y3.  x3 = 300;  @ = art tan (( 800 - 100)/(500 - 270) = 71.81 degrees;  y3 = 100 + x3/tan(@) = 100;  x2=500,y2=800. How do I prove XDraw line() give me the right x3, y3 or not? Please don't ask me why I don't created a 900x900 pix map.
