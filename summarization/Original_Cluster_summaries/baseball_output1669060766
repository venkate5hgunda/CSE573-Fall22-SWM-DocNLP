Frank Tanana:  1-0, 1.50  I am curious to known if there are any professional sports teams whose games are regularly broadcast on an FM station.
Mike: If the score is beyond 2-1 I can't see my family that night at all. Consider a night game starting at 7:05 PM EST. The later the game goes, the colder it gets on the shore of Lake Erie. If you say you don't care about whether the game is sped up, IMPO you are saying you don’t care where the time goes.
Gary Gaetti played with the Twins in '87 for the world series, and again in '88 (note that's his lowest of the 4) I believe the next 3 (or at least the last two) were played withThe Angels. Watch out Boston, Toronto, and Baltimore - the Motor City Kittys are back.
I'm a little worried about this pitching thing. Mesa (sp?) seems to be settling down. I heard the guys on ESPN say that 7 of the TRIBE's top 10 prospects are pitchers. Is it probable that I'll be able to walk up and get bleacher seats (2 or 3) on game day?
Pablo A Iglesias asks why a pitcher is given 8 pitches when he enters the game. David Robert Walker says he wouldn't give baserunning that much value. Joseph Hernandez posts daily standings and results on USENET. He is free of charge and has no copyright restrictions.
There are 986 people on my mailing list that branches off into other mailing lists available for many others. The list grows by an average of 35 people a day. Having one person, such as yourself, who does it is a great idea. Having 100 do it is not. that's all.
WIP took two of your best sports jockeys too, Jody MacDonald and Steve Fredericks. Is Ron Gant still swinging his bat the way he was last year (trying to hit to all fields, etc.) or has he changed his swing back to the "old" Gant and is just in a small early season slump.
